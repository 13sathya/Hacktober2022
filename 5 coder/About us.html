    Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 – c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist.[1] He is most well-known for creating the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B programming language.[1] Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr.
   </p>
   <h1>Personal career and Life</h1>
   <p>Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime Bell Labs scientist and co-author of The Design of Switching Circuits[7] on switching circuit theory.[8] As a child, Dennis moved with his family to Summit, New Jersey, where he graduated from Summit High School.[9] He graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics and applied mathematics.[8]

    Version 7 Unix for the PDP-11, including Dennis Ritchie's home directory: /usr/dmr
    In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, and in 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on "Computational Complexity and Program Structure" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree as he did not submit a bound copy of his dissertation to the Harvard library, a requirement for the degree.[10][11] In 2020, the Computer History Museum worked with Ritchie's family and Fischer's family and found a copy of the lost dissertation.[11]
    
    During the 1960s, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970, Brian Kernighan suggested the name "Unix", a pun on the name "Multics".[12] To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created B. Later, B was replaced by C, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C for many years.[13]
    
    During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.[14] Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the National Security Agency, the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle was applicable to machines still in use by foreign governments.[14]
    
    Ritchie was also involved with the development of the Plan 9 and Inferno operating systems, and the programming language Limbo.
    
    As part of an AT&T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.[15]</p>
    <h1>Awards</h1>
    <p>
        In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award "for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system".[20] Ritchie's Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research".[21] In 1990, both Ritchie and Thompson received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language".[22]

In 1997, both Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language."[23]

On April 21, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".[24][25]

In 2005, the Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.[26]

In 2011, Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.[27]
