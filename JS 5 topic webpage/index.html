  JavaScript Syntax </h1></b></p>
JavaScript syntax is the set of rules that define a structured JavaScript. Here are some tips to remember when writing your first JavaScript program.

Case Sensitivity – JavaScript is case sensitive i.e., upper case letter and lower-case letter has different meaning.
Whitespace & Semi Colon – Spaces, tabs, and newlines that are present in JavaScript programmes are ignored by JavaScript.

      Data Types
    </b>
  </h1>
</p>
The classification of the types of data that a variable or object can store is known as a data type.

There are two type of datatype –

Primitive Data Type
Non-Primitive Data Type
Primitive Data Type
JavaScript supports three basic data types –

Numeric – Numeric type has two type viz. Integer and floating point. Integer is a whole number such as 145, -9 etc. It can be expressed in decimal base(10), octal base (8), hexadecimal (16) of both positive and negative values. Floating point are values with decimal value or fractional value.
String – Strings are collection of characters which are enclosed with either single or double quotes.
Boolean – This type of data contains only two value i.e. true or false or 0 or 1.
 When these values are compared then true value is taken as 1 and false value is taken as 0.
Composite Data Types (Non-Primitive Data Type)
When a data type declares several identical or dissimilar data under a single variable declaration, or when the data type includes multiple values grouped together, the data type is referred to as a composite data type. The three primary categories of composite data types are listed below. Array. Function.
<br><br>
Variables
Anything that can change is considered variable. A variable saves the data value in JavaScript and allows for future data value changes. If you want to declare a variable in JavaScript, use the reserved term var.
<br><br>
Variables can be thought of as named containers in the computer’s memory. You can place data in these containers and refer to the value using the name.
A variable consists of an identifier, a scope and a specific data type
An Identifier is the name of a variable.
Usefulness of Variable
When code is written they can be used in place of unknown value.
When script is written or updated then it saves the time
Then clearer the purpose of code because you can give the meaningful name which make the code easy to read.
Variable Naming Convention
JavaScript has some rules when we give the name to the variable.
<br><br>

Case Sensitivity – JavaScript variables are case sensitive.
Use Valid Characters – A variable must begin with underscore or letter only. All other characters are invalid to start the variable name. Variable must not contains blank spaces.
Avoid Reserved Words – Reserved words are the special words which has specific meaning in JavaScript.
Variable Declaration and Initialization
Variables in JavaScript can be defined using the keyword var.
The equal to (=) sign is used to assign a value to a variable.
Note that var is the keyword in JavaScript.
Users can either, separately declare the variable and then assign values to it or straight-away declare and initialize the variables.
Variable Scope
The scope of a variable refers to the area of a program in which it can be accessed. Variables have two types of scopes – global scope and local scope.
<br><br>
Global Scope – Outside of a function, global variables are defined to be accessible throughout the entire programme.
Local Scope – Using the var keyword, local variables are kept in a function and can only be used inside the confines of that function.

  <p><h1><b>Built-in Functions/Object for Numerical Calculation</b></h1></p>


  <h3>Basic Math Operation </h3>
isNaN() – NaN stands for “Not-a-Number” in JavaScript. This method checks whether passing argument is a number or not. It returns true or false value as a result.
<br><br><br>
document.write( isNaN(4) ) // will return false.
document.write( isNaN(“4”) ) // will return false.
document.write( isNaN(“four”) ) // will return true.
<br><br><br>
valueOf() – This method return a number of a given variable. For example
var x =345;
x.valueOf() // will return 345;
<br><br><br>
Math.round(x) – It returns the rounded value of passing number to its nearest integer. For example:
Math.round(6.7) //returns 7
Math.round(6.4) //returns 6
<br><br><br>
Math.pow(x,y) – It returns the power of x based on y. For example:
Math.pow(3,4) //returns 81
<br><br>
Math.sqrt(x) – It returns the square root of x. For example:
Maths.sqrt(81) //returns 9
<br><br>
Math.ceil(x) – It returns the greater or equal to integer value of x.
Math.ceil(6.4) //returns 7
<br><br>
Math.floor(x) – It returns the less or equal to integer value of x
<br><br>
Math.floor(6.4) //returns 6
Math.ceil(3.9) //returns 3
<br><br>
Basic String Operations
Length() – It returns the length of a string including white space(s). For example
var str = “Hello javaScript”;
document.write(str.length); // it returns the 16.
<br><br>
Search() – It returns the starting location of passing string otherwise returns -1.
var str = “This is my first script in JavaScript”
str.search(“script”); //returns 17
<br><br><br>
Substring() – It extract the substring by taking the starting and ending position as argument. You can omit ending position then it will extract the string from starting position to end of the string.
var str = “This is my first script in JavaScript”
str.substring(7,16) // returns “my first” as substring

<p><h1><b>Data Type Conversion</b></h1></p>


The process of transforming data from one type to another is known as type conversion. Changing data from a String to a Number, for instance. In JavaScript, there are two types of type conversion. Automatic type conversion is known as implicit conversion. Manual type conversion is known as explicit conversion.
<br><br>
Implicit Type Conversion
JavaScript occasionally automatically changes one data type to another (to the right type). Implicit conversion describes this situation.
<br><br>
Example 1 – document.write("3" + "1");
<br><br>
Output – 4
<br><br>
Example 2 – document.write(3 + "1");
<br><br>
Output – 4
<br><br>
In example 1, both value having string type but due to Implicit Type Conversion value automatically converted in numerical value.
<br><br>
Explicit Type Conversion
This type of conversion is done by developer by using the inbuilt method of type conversions.
<br><br>
Number() – This method is used to convert any type to number type.
Number (“40”) convert string value “40” to 40.
<br><br>
Number (null) convert null to 0
<br><br>
parseInt() – This method returns the integer value by accepting two argument.
parseInt (“10”) returns 10
parseInt (“40.33”) returns 40
<br><br>
parseFloat() – This method returns the integer value by accepting one string argument.
parseFloat(“23”) returns 23
parseFloat(“23.55”) returns 23.55
<br><br>
eval() – This method accept the JavaScript expression as an string argument. It then evaluates the expression and return the result after execution. If no result is obtained the it returns undefined as a result. For example:
eval (“ 8*4/2”) returns 16 as result
<br><br>
Converting String
String() method is used to convert any type to string value whereas possible by accepting one argument.
<br><br>
string (40) converted to “40”
<br><br>
Converting Boolean
Boolean() method convert any type to Boolean type which is supported.
<br><br><br>
Boolean(25) returns true.
