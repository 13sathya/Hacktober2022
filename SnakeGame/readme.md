Classic snake game :snake:

The objective is simple: Walk without hitting anything and absorb/capture the square that appears on the screen, thus, you will gain points and increase in size.

The game starts slowly, but as the score goes up the speed will also increase.

Use the arrow keys to move up, down, right and left.
:arrow_up_small: :arrow_down_small: :arrow_backward: :arrow_forward:

Avoid the edges, bumping into them will be game over.
When it collides with any part of your body, the game is also over. When this happens, a warning message will appear. You can start over and try to beat your previous record.

Have fun playing! :smiley:
