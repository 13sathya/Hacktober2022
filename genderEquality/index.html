        Girls and boys see gender inequality in their homes and communities
        every day – in textbooks, in the media and among the adults who care for
        them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Parents may assume unequal responsibility for household work, with
        mothers bearing the brunt of caregiving and chores. The majority of
        low-skilled and underpaid community health workers who attend to
        children are also women, with limited opportunity for professional
        growth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        And in schools, many girls receive less support than boys to pursue the
        studies they choose. This happens for a variety of reasons: The safety,
        hygiene and sanitation needs of girls may be neglected, barring them
        from regularly attending class. Discriminatory teaching practices and
        education materials also produce gender gaps in learning and skills
        development. As a result, nearly 1 in 4 girls between the ages of 15 and
        19 are neither employed nor in education or training – compared to 1 in
        10 boys.
      </p>

        Worldwide, nearly 1 in 4 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are neither
        employed nor in education or training – compared to 1 in 10 boys.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Yet, in early childhood, gender disparities start out small. Girls have
        higher survival rates at birth, are more likely to be developmentally on
        track, and are just as likely to participate in preschool. Among those
        who reach secondary school, girls tend to outperform boys in reading
        across every country where data are available.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But the onset of adolescence can bring significant barriers to girls’
        well-being. Gender norms and discrimination heighten their risk of
        unwanted pregnancy, HIV and AIDS, and malnutrition. Especially in
        emergency settings and in places where menstruation remains taboo, girls
        are cut off from the information and supplies they need to stay healthy
        and safe.

          Investing in girls’ education transforms communities, countries and
          the entire world. Girls who receive an education are less likely to
          marry young and more likely to lead healthy, productive lives. They
          earn higher incomes, participate in the decisions that most affect
          them, and build better futures for themselves and their families.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Girls’ education strengthens economies and reduces inequality. It
          contributes to more stable, resilient societies that give all
          individuals – including boys and men – the opportunity to fulfil their
          potential.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But education for girls is about more than access to school. It’s also
          about girls feeling safe in classrooms and supported in the subjects
          and careers they choose to pursue – including those in which they are
          often under-represented.

          Despite evidence demonstrating how central girls’ education is to
          development, gender disparities in education persist.

        <p>
          Around the world, 129 million girls are out of school, including 32
          million of primary school age, 30 million of lower-secondary school
          age, and 67 million of upper-secondary school age. In countries
          affected by conflict, girls are more than twice as likely to be out of
          school than girls living in non-affected countries.

      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <br />
        <p>
          Only 49 per cent of countries have achieved gender parity in primary
          education. At the secondary level, the gap widens: 42 per cent of
          countries have achieved gender parity in lower secondary education,
          and 24 per cent in upper secondary education.

          In some places, schools do not meet the safety, hygiene or sanitation
          needs of girls. In others, teaching practices are not
          gender-responsive and result in gender gaps in learning and skills
          development.

        <p>
          In 2022, we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the International Day
          of the Girl (IDG). In these last 10 years, there has been increased
          attention on issues that matter to girls amongst governments,
          policymakers and the general public, and more opportunities for girls
          to have their voices heard on the global stage. Yet, investments in
          girls’ rights remain limited and girls continue to confront a myriad
          of challenges to fulfilling their potential; made worse by concurrent
          crises of climate change, COVID-19 and humanitarian conflict. Girls
          around the world continue to face unprecedented challenges to their
          education, their physical and mental wellness, and the protections
          needed for a life without violence. Girls with disabilities face
          additional barriers to accessing support and services. COVID-19 has
          worsened existing burdens on girls around the world and worn away
          important gains made over the last decade.

          With adversity, however, comes resourcefulness, creativity, tenacity,
          and resilience. The world's 600 million adolescent girls have shown
          time and time again that given the skills and the opportunities, they
          can be the changemakers driving progress in their communities,
          building back stronger for all, including women, boys and men.

          Girls are ready for a decade of acceleration forward. It is time for
          us all to stand accountable – with and for girls – and to invest in a
          future that believes in their agency, leadership and potential.

          Partnering with national health sectors to expand quality maternal

          front-line community health workforce. It means promoting the role of
          women in the design and delivery of water, sanitation and hygiene

          ensure girls and boys thrive in their learning and find pathways to
          meaningful employment.

          For adolescent girls especially, Goverment invests in skills building
          to further their economic empowerment – as entrepreneurs, innovators
          and leaders. We focus on providing learning environments at a time and
          place that suit girls’ individual circumstances. We also work on
          assistive technologies for girls with disabilities, and on the
          expansion of digital platforms, vocational training and
          apprenticeships.

          Supporting girls’ pathway from education to employment requires more
          than learning opportunities. It requires keeping girls safe from all
          forms of violence, in and out of school.

          Goverment's targeted initiatives to prevent and respond to
          gender-based violence help end child marriage, eliminate female
          genital mutilation, provide safe spaces, support menstrual health
          management, deliver HIV and AIDS care, meet psychosocial needs and
          more. We invest in innovative models that protect even the
          hardest-to-reach girls – like virtual safe spaces and apps that allow
          them to report violence and connect to local resources for support.
