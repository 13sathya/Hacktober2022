This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

## Deployed on Netlify

This website is already deployed on Netlify. This is the link: [HULU 2.0](https://hulu-3.netlify.app)


## API Documentation

The data recieved for this project is from [Movies database](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The API requires a special key and you can get it for free by signing up. The API key needs to be included in an .env file like this KEY=abcdefg123455!#@$ (P.S: This is not a key, I just randomly typed :D). Just create a new .env.local file and create a variable name KEY and equate it to your key which you can get from your account and that's all! Enjoy!!!
